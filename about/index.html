      <h1>What is a Tipsy Bear?</h1>
      <p class="lead">This site originally started as a beer brewing blog.
      We wanted to do data science projects, and we figured it was an
      awesome name, thus here we are! We like bourbon, data science, and
      long walks on the beach. And making really cool things.</p>

      <h2>The Webpage of Tipsy Bear</h2>
      <p>This simple website was built quickly because of the hard work of
      a lot of people who develop open source projects. We want to thank
      them for making it possible for us to have a website while we do data
      science projects. In return, our projects are also open source! If
      you would like to use the tools that we're using, then here are the
      links back to our sources.</p>

      <h4>Hosting</h4>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> hosts all of our code and
      also provides hosting for this site via <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github
      Pages</a>. This page is built when we push a commit into our repository
      with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a pretty cool static page blog generator.</p>
      <p><a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> does all the comment handling and discussion
      moderation for us, which is pretty cool since it's for free. Our contact form (and any
      other form you may see on this website) is powered with <a href="http://getsimpleform.com/">Simple Form</a>.

      <h4>Design</h4>
      <p>It's probably pretty obvious, but this page was built with
      <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, which we love for our web
      applications (we're not really designers). The icons come from two places:
      <a href="http://fontawesome.io/">Font Awesome</a> and <a href="http://glyphicons.com/">Glyphicons</a>.</p>

      <p>The Metro D.C. wallpaper we use in our jumbotron on the front page is from
      <a href="http://www.kulfoto.com/interesting-things/wallpaper/1/11839/washington-d-c-metro">KULfoto</a>.
      The bear silhoutte that we're using as our tiny logo is from <a href="http://vector-magz.com/animals/bear-silhouette-item-5/">Vector-magz.com</a>.</p>

      <p>I hope that's everyone- thank you guys all so much!</p>
