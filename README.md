===================

This repository contains the pages and data for the Tipsy Bear Studios
website. It is automatically transformed by
[Jekyll][jekyll] into a static site when the
repository is pushed to GitHub (thanks to
[Github Pages][github-pages]). We find this incredibly useful,
we can work on pages/the site together without having to worry about
remote servers and databases. It also gives us collaboration flexibility
AND versioning without a Content Management System (CMS),
which [Allen][allen] HATES to build!

This site was made with &spades; by [@bbengfort][ben] and
[@looselycoupled][allen].
