Well, it's official- Tipsy Bear is no more, long live Tipsy Bear Studios!
If you want homebrew, I'm going to have to ask you to talk to
[@andyhkeller](https://twitter.com/andyhkeller); he's a pro now after all!
We'll go ahead and give him the title "Brewmaster Bear". Tipsy Bear has
moved on to its true calling- drinking bourbon while doing Data Science!

So this is how it went down: Allen and I have projects we want to do
together. It's easiest to form an organization for things like Github and
Travis. Ben and Allen Studios seemed dumb. "Two Winstons" seemed awesome,
but we didn't really want to purchase the domain. What to do? Go through
all the domains you already own! (Which by the way, if you want to do a
project with me, I've got "tacticalchicken.com", "splosionfish.com" and
"musetwelve" all available if interested!)

Tipsy Bear had originally been a blog about my chemistry fascination,
particularly the fermentation of barely. Like I said, Andy took that title
from me, and I loaned most of my brew kit away already anyway. The old blog
is on my server, but not being used.

So we took over the domain, setup a Github organization- then got Github
Pages (with Jekyll) for this site, and we're going to start working on
Data Science projects. Stay tuned for more!
